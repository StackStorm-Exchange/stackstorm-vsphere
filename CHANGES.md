## v0.15.1

## v0.15.0

Added new action:
* `vsphere.cluster_get` - Retrieve a list of clusters with summary information and an ID from vCenter
* `vsphere.datacenter_get` - Retrieve a list of datacenters with configuration information and an ID from vCenter
* `vsphere.template_get` - Retrieve a list of templates with summary information and an ID from vCenter

Changed action:
* `vsphere.datastore_get` - Fixed action to allow passing ids or names and still work properly. Fixed duplicate check so its working now and the same item is not added twice to the list when specifing name or id.
* `vsphere.network_get` - Fixed action to allow passing ids or names and still work properly. Fixed duplicate check so its working now and the same item is not added twice to the list when specifing name or id.
* `vsphere.get_tags_from_objects` - Fixed action to handle tag categories that can have multiple values. Fixed duplicate check so its working now and the same item is not added twice to the list when specifing name or id.
* `vsphere.vm_hw_basic_build` - Converted from Mistral workflow to Orquesta workflow

## v0.14.0

Added new action:
* `vsphere.network_get` - Retrieve a list of networks with summary information and an ID from vCenter

Changed action:
* `vsphere.datastore_get` - Updated the action to include the ID of the datastore in the return.

## V0.5.1

Minor linting errors

## V0.5.0

Addition of DataCenter imput field for VM creation action and workflow. Fall back continues to function as present Although this should be provided if Multiple Datacenters are under a single Vsphere instance.

Update the `TaskInfoSensor` to enable handling uncompleted Tasks.

## V0.4.8

Update config.schema.yaml to support any name for vcenters

Added custom JSON Encoder class to serialize VM summary (`vsphere.vm_hw_details_get`) output, hence, allowing results to be a list of dicts instead of strings. Makes it easier to access the results later in the workflows or action chains.
